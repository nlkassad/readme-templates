## Setup & Dependencies

### Dependencies

Install with '[enter command here]'.

-   [`resource`](resourceURL)
-   [`resource`](resourceURL)

Additional dependencies

-   [`resource`](resourceURL) (install with `[enter command here]`)

### Local setup

-   `[enter command here]`

[//]: # (consider moving this to a different section)
### Tests

`curl` command scripts for all actions are stored in [`scripts`](scripts) with names that
correspond to API actions.

Note that in order to run the upload script, you must run it from within the scripts directory.

[//]: # (this should provide some general information about the API and it's purpose)

[//]: # (exceptions to standard restful behavior)
## Pragmatic REST

These guidelines aim to support a truly RESTful API. Here are a few exceptions:
* [exception to rule].
* [exception to rule]:
    * referenceURL
    * referenceURL

## RESTful URLs

[//]: # (intro information for users, can be left as default)
### General guidelines for RESTful URLs
* A URL identifies a resource.
* URLs should include nouns, not verbs.
* Use plural nouns only for consistency (no singular nouns).
* Use HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to operate on the collections and elements.
* You shouldn’t need to go deeper than resource/identifier/resource.
* Put the version number at the base of your URL, for example http://example.com/v1/path/to/resource.
* URL v. header:
    * If it changes the logic you write to handle the response, put it in the URL.
    * If it doesn’t change the logic for each response, like OAuth info, put it in the header.
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list.
* Formats should be in the form of api/v2/resource/{id}.json

[//]: # (provide some examples of your URL structure for calls to the API)
### Good URL examples
* List of magazines:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json
* Filtering is a query:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?year=2011&sort=desc
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines.json?topic=economy&year=2011
* A single magazine in JSON format:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json
* All articles in (or belonging to) this magazine:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.json
* All articles in this magazine in XML format:
    * GET http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles.xml
* Specify optional fields in a comma separated list:
    * GET http://www.example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234.json?fields=title,subtitle,date
* Add a new article to a particular magazine:
    * POST http://example.gov/api/v1/magazines/1234/articles

[//]: # (Provide some examples of URLs that will not work particularly if they may seem logical)
### Bad URL examples
* Non-plural noun:
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine/1234
    * http://www.example.gov/publisher/magazine/1234
* Verb in URL:
    * http://www.example.gov/magazine/1234/create
* Filter outside of query string
    * http://www.example.gov/magazines/2011/desc

## HTTP Verbs

HTTP verbs, or methods, should be used in compliance with their definitions under the [HTTP/1.1](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) standard.
The action taken on the representation will be contextual to the media type being worked on and its current state. Here's an example of how HTTP verbs map to create, read, update, delete operations in a particular context:

[//]: # (Formatting for listing verbs, better for listing all verbs)
| HTTP METHOD | POST            | GET       | PUT         | DELETE |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| CRUD OP     | CREATE          | READ      | UPDATE      | DELETE |
| /dogs       | Create new dogs | List dogs | Bulk update | Delete all dogs |
| /dogs/1234  | Error           | Show Bo   | If exists, update Bo; If not, error | Delete Bo |

(Example from Web API Design, by Brian Mulloy, Apigee.)

[//]: # (Alternate formatting for listing verbs. Better for breaking verbs into sections)
| Verb   | URI Pattern            | Controller#Action |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|
| POST   | `/sign-up`             | `users#signup`    |
| POST   | `/sign-in`             | `users#signin`    |
| PATCH  | `/change-password/:id` | `users#changepw`  |
| DELETE | `/sign-out/:id`        | `users#signout`   |


[//]: # (sample responses to api calls)
## Responses

* No values in keys
* No internal-specific names (e.g. "node" and "taxonomy term")
* Metadata should only contain direct properties of the response set, not properties of the members of the response set

### Good examples

No values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"id": "125", "name": "Environment"},
      {"id": "834", "name": "Water Quality"}
    ],


### Bad examples

Values in keys:

    "tags": [
      {"125": "Environment"},
      {"834": "Water Quality"}
    ],


[//]: # (provide examples of what a user should expect from error responses)
## Errors

Error responses should include a common HTTP status code, message for the developer, message for the end-user (when appropriate), internal error code (corresponding to some specific internally determined ID), links where developers can find more info. For example:

    {
      "status" : 400,
      "developerMessage" : "Verbose, plain language description of the problem. Provide developers
       suggestions about how to solve their problems here",
      "userMessage" : "This is a message that can be passed along to end-users, if needed.",
      "errorCode" : "444444",
      "moreInfo" : "http://www.example.gov/developer/path/to/help/for/444444,
       http://drupal.org/node/444444",
    }

Use three simple, common response codes indicating (1) success, (2) failure due to client-side problem, (3) failure due to server-side problem:
* 200 - OK
* 400 - Bad Request
* 500 - Internal Server Error


[//]: # (provide the API version here)
## Versions

* Never release an API without a version number.
* Versions should be integers, not decimal numbers, prefixed with ‘v’. For example:
    * Good: v1, v2, v3
    * Acceptable: v1.2 (for subversions)
    * Bad: v-1.1, v1.2, 1.3
* Maintain APIs at least one version back.

[//]: # (Provide information about limits to returned records here)
## Record limits

* If no limit is specified, return results with a default limit.
* To get records 51 through 75 do this:
    * http://example.gov/magazines?limit=25&offset=50
    * offset=50 means, ‘skip the first 50 records’
    * limit=25 means, ‘return a maximum of 25 records’

Information about record limits and total available count should also be included in the response. Example:

    {
        "metadata": {
            "resultset": {
                "count": 227,
                "offset": 25,
                "limit": 25
            }
        },
        "results": []
    }

        }
    ]


## Mock Responses
It is suggested that each resource accept a 'mock' parameter on the testing server. Passing this parameter should return a mock data response (bypassing the backend).

Implementing this feature early in development ensures that the API will exhibit consistent behavior, supporting a test driven development methodology.

Note: If the mock parameter is included in a request to the production environment, an error should be raised.


## JSONP

JSONP is easiest explained with an example. Here's one from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/what-is-jsonp-all-about?answertab=votes#tab-top):

> Say you're on domain abc.com, and you want to make a request to domain xyz.com. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland.

> The one item that bypasses this limitation is `<script>` tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really DO anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated.

> Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle.

> For example, say the server expects a parameter called "callback" to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like:

>         http://www.xyz.com/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback

> Without JSONP, this might return some basic javascript object, like so:

>         { foo: 'bar' }

> However, with JSONP, when the server receives the "callback" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this:

>         mycallback({ foo: 'bar' });

> As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function:

>         mycallback = function(data){
>             alert(data.foo);
>         };
